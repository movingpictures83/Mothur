# Dependency: Requires Mothur to be installed
# Input: MOTHUR (input Mothur file)
# Output: none (screen and output files specified in the .mothur input file)

PluMA plugin that runs Mothur software (Schloss, 2009) (generated by PluGen).
The plugin accepts as input a program in the Mothur domain-specific language (DSL),
similar to the software itself.  We leave the output as "none", since 
the input program will likely produce multiple output files through commands
in the DSL.
